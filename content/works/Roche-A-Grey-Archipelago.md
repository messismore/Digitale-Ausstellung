# A Grey Archipelago

## Flood

Berlin's landscape was shaped by glaciers between 24.000 and 17.000 years ago. Meltwater flowing westwards, parallelly to the glaciers' edge, dug out the Warschau-Berliner Urstromtal, depositing sands particularly permeable to water.

The resulting wetlands were drained during urbanization, a process to which some streets (Kurf√ºrstendamm, Kaiserdamm) own their names. Today, the city's watery past hides within pink pipes. It also resurfaces every summer, when heavy rains raise the groundwater above the street surface, flooding the low-lying parts of the city.

This project starts by imagining an endless summer rain that renders this situation permanent, turning Berlin back into a swamp.

The first consequences are clear. Public transportation fails quickly, the power grid soon follows. Fuel becomes scarce, paralyzing supply chains. After a few weeks, the government flees southwards to safety, joined by those who can afford it. At the same time, refugees from worse affected areas converge towards Berlin.

The long-term outcome, however, is harder to imagine from today's perspective. How to conceive of a future for the city within these new rules? How can these new rules even be described?
